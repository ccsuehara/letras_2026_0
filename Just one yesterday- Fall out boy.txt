Just One Yesterday-Fall Out Boy

I thought of angels choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them, pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
If heaven's grief brings hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you) oh
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday
